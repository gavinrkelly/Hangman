# Hangman
How to use HangmanReal.java:

Install JGrasp from the software center on your computer. Also install JDK from the software center.
DrawingPanel.java and hangamn.txt must be saved in the same folder as HangmanReal.java for the game to be able to be played.
Open HangmanReal.java in JGrasp and press ctrl r to start the game. You are also able to edit the game now in JGrasp. If the game doesn’t start check that DrawingPanel.java and hangamn.txt are saved in the same folder and open them in JGrasp, then try again.
The game follows the same rules as classic hangman. The player guesses one lower case letter at a time. For each wrong guess a body part is drawn. For each correct guess, all the letters that match the guess in the word are drawn. So if there is two of the same letter in the word they will both be drawn. If the body is complete before you guess the word you lose. When the game ends type “yes” to play again and “no” if you don’t want to. 
Guesses must be inputted into the box below the code where the game is asking for your guess. Input a lowercase letter like “a” and then press enter.
The Wordle word list was used for HangmanReal.java, so every word is five letters and a lot of them are pretty tricky.
Comments are added to the code to explain the purpose of each section of code.
